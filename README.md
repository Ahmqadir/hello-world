# hello-world
My first github experience...
Hello, my name is Ahmad Mubarak. I'm from Nigeria, 34 & i have always been interested in computers & technology. Some years back, i started off with computer netowrking, Cisco, then Microsoft, Comptia A+, N+, CEH, went through all the video tutorials but never got certified. Partly because i couldn't pay for the exams & then later on i got side tracked with a demanding job. Well recently i decided to try out web design. I always thought programming was very difficult, so i'm trying out just web design instead. Though i signed up for an online Harvard course with edx, CS50. Lets just see how far i can go with this..... Thanks for reading...
